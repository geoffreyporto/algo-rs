algo-rs
=======

Assorted algorithms implemented in Rust. Currently have:
* kth-largest element in an unsorted sequence - QuickSelect, expected O(n)
* minimum spanning tree - Kruskal's, O(|E| log |E|)
* max flow - Ford-Fulkerson, O(nF)
* 2D closest pair - grid approach, expected O(n)

Also comes with custom graph implementation.

Todo:
* Augmented trees
* Karp-Rabin
* DP/memoization framework
* Suffix trees
* Epsilon heavy hitters
* Convex hull
* Perceptron
* FFT
