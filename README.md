* kth-largest element in an unsorted sequence - O(n)
* minimum spanning tree - O(|E| log |E|)

Also comes with custom graph implementation.

Todo:
* Augmented trees
* Karp-Rabin
* DP/memoization framework
* Max-flow
* Suffix trees
* Epsilon heavy hitters
* Convex hull
* Closest pairs
* Perceptron
* FFT
